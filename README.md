# SpotifyPlaylists

## __Todo__:
* [ ] Backend
  * [x] Configure OAuth 2.0 (hopefully without a browser, use this -> https://www.programcreek.com/java-api-examples/?api=com.wrapper.spotify.Api) 
  	* Completed on November 5 by Dante 
  * [ ] See if TomTom Maps will work at all in the United States because it currently doesn't
  * [ ] Refactor the project
  	* [x] Chose to not worry about storing API keys securely, but there are ways to do that 
  * [x] Write playlists to a user account using OAuth 2.0 
  	* Completed on November 13 by Dante (this was a pain)
  * [x] Look into Jamendo API (stretch goal) 
  	* Completed on November 17 by Dante
  	* This isn't going to be able to be implemented because it costs money and it is also a really poorly designed API
  * [ ] Write unit tests for code that can feasibly be tested
  * [ ] Figure out expected outputs to give to front end 

* [ ] Frontend
	* [ ] Choose a technology that will be used (Swing or JavaFX)
	* [ ] Design it on paper (rough draft)
	* [ ] Build rough draft 
  * [ ] Integrate it with the backend 
  
* [ ] Other
    * [ ] Javadocs
    * [ ] Bug catcher
    * [ ] Code coverage 
    * [ ] Other stuff I can't think of right now
