## __Todo__:
* [] Backend
  * [] Configure OAuth 2.0 (hopefully without a browser, use this -> https://www.programcreek.com/java-api-examples/?api=com.wrapper.spotify.Api)
  * [] See if TomTom Maps will work at all in the United States because it currently doesn't
  * [] Refactor the project so that it actually uses OO principles (Inheritance, etc.)
  * [] Write playlists to a user account using OAuth 2.0
  * [] Look into Jamendo API (stretch goal)
  * [] Write unit tests for code that can feasibly be tested
  * [] Figure out expected outputs to give to front end 

* [] Frontend
	* [] Choose a technology that will be used (Swing or JavaFX)
	* [] Design it on paper (rough draft)
	* [] Build rough draft 
  * [] Integrate it with the backend 
  
* [] Other
    * [] Bug catcher
    * [] Code coverage 
    * [] Other stuff I can't think of right now
