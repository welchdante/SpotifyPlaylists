# SpotifyPlaylists

## __Todo__:
* [ ] Backend
  * [x] Configure OAuth 2.0 (hopefully without a browser, use this -> https://www.programcreek.com/java-api-examples/?api=com.wrapper.spotify.Api) 
  	* Completed on November 5 by Dante 
  * [x] See if TomTom Maps will work at all in the United States because it currently doesn't
  	* Completed on November 17 by Dante
	* Nope, we are only travelling in Europe. It would be nice to have Google maps.
  * [x] Refactor the project
  	* [x] Chose to not worry about storing API keys securely, but there are ways to do that 
	* Mostly completed by Dante on November 17
  * [x] Write playlists to a user account using OAuth 2.0 
  	* Completed on November 13 by Dante (this was a pain)
  * [x] Look into Jamendo API (stretch goal) 
  	* Completed on November 17 by Dante
  	* This isn't going to be able to be implemented because it costs money and it is also a really poorly designed API
  * [ ] Write unit tests for code that can feasibly be tested
  	* Began by Dant on November 17, need to ask how much we need to test because mocking stuff is hard
  * [x] Figure out expected outputs to give to front end 
  	* Completed by Dante on November 17
	* Should be good to go now that Javadocs are done. See RoadTripPlaylistBuilder for the general flow of how the GUI should flow. 

* [ ] Frontend
	* [ ] Choose a technology that will be used (Swing or JavaFX)
	* [ ] Design it on paper (rough draft)
	* [ ] Build rough draft 
  * [ ] Integrate it with the backend 
  
* [ ] Other
    * [x] Javadocs
	    	* Completed by Dante on November 17.
		* Just need to generate them at the end. 
    * [ ] Bug catcher
    * [ ] Code coverage 
    		* Figured out by Dante on November 17
    		* Run the tests with coverage and BOOM it just shows up.
    * [ ] Other stuff I can't think of right now
